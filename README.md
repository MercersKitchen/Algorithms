# Beginning Ideas

Beginning Ideas:
- Algorithms for making the calculator do arithmetic, we use answers
- Output to console, use character escapes
- Use primitive variables & a simple array declaration with {} population in declaration
  - Exposure to iterating over array with FOR Loop for sequences and series

### Ideas to create Processing Code in Above Folders

Mathematics and Algorithms for End-user Ideas
- Counting Patterns and Concepts (how does a Math 10C count?)
  - See: COuntingPatternsCoding.pde
  - Forwards
  - Backwards
  - Arithmetic
  - Geometric
  - Squares
  - Enrichment: Combinations (slope, polynomials, etc.)
  - Enrichment: Using time from the Operating System or in Processing-Java (milli-seconds from crystal)
- Summarizing counting into
  - Use Primitive Alpha-numeric leading to simplified array population with {}
  - Ranges (max - min)
  - Central Tendency: mean, median, mode
- Start and stop counting (boundaries of variables): counting until place value change like >$100
  - Evaluating with simple IF
  - Evaluating type of number with modulus (even vs. odd)
  - Console output to whether code makes it into IF
- Separating the GUI Space intentionally for feedback
  - Nested counting (nested FOR Loops)
  - "Chess Board" or "Table for Tiles on a Tablet Screen"
- Changing Visual Data based on calculations
  - Hello World Type Programs for developing touch screens
  - Clicking Game with timer, taking best times and giving feedback on times that seem in error
- Ratios of Width and Height using Variables: how to write a program's GUI to any monitor
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI): communication with device before program executes
  - Delivers geometry
  - Screensize checker based on fullScreen key variables
  - Use exit(), demonstrate Processing.org reference page
  - Transition to Happy Measles by drawing 2D Shapes to middle of canvas

## Student Intro Searching and Sorting Assignments

**Begin with Flat Programs to test structured programming execution, then move to *Objects***.
- Note: all object programs must be written with Processing-JAVA Drivers and Pure Java Classes

### Assignment List and Details

Linear Search
1. Flat Numbers Search - Teaching Exemplar
2. Flat Strings-word Search, single word - Teaching Exemplar
3. Flat String- Phrase to Word copy of arrays, then search each word for a target letters
- Note: use Sentence with all letters of alphabet (similar to old Morse Code short sentences)

- Purpose of Linear Search
  - Review `print()`, `println()`, and `character escapes`
  - Review FOR(){} increasing Big-O
  - Review simple array searches
  - Review String Functions in Pure Java

Binary Search
- **CAUTION:** search space must be organized first, according to expectation of binary search code
- For Example:
  - Smallest to Largest
  - Largest to Smallest (Numerical Values)
  - Aphetically (knowing how to get back to original?)


**TBA**
