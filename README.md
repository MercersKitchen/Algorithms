# Algorithms
Computer Science is about algorithms. We use code to interpret algorithms and make a computer work.

Algorithms contain the following sections ...
- Triggers
- Data to work on
- produce at least one result
- terminate after successful measure'
Make sure to identify each one in your code

Building Algorithms requires "Divide & Conquer" Concept
- Build something small that does part of what you want
- Add to it without changing a lot of the code already written (modularity)

# Beginning Algorithms

Beginning Ideas:
- Algorithms for making the computer do arithmetic, we use math
- Output to console, use character escapes and verify variable values
- Use primitive variables & a simple array declaration with {} population in declaration
  - Exposure to iterating over array with FOR Loop for sequences and series

Note: download the program and play with it until it works ... Bugs are intentional

### Teaching Apps
- Forward: static demonstrates `while()` (similar to `draw()`)
- Forward: skipping counting with app start, keyBoard and mouse triggers
  - Explore Arithmetic Operators:
    - `+=`
    - `=+`
    - `-=`
    - `=-`
    - `*=`
    - `=*`
    - `/=`
    - `=/`
  - Write a program to demonstrate the differences

**CONTINUE HERE**
- Boolean is Trigger, User controlled
- Stops at ??? 1000 or zero

### Processing Code in Above Folders

Counting Patterns and Concepts, See: CountingPatternsCoding.pde
-
- Backwards
- Arithmetic
- "Accumulation (keeping a running total)"
- Geometric
- Squares
- Enrichment: Combinations (slope, polynomials, etc.)
- Enrichment: Using time from the Operating System or in Processing-Java (milli-seconds from crystal)

Summarizing counting into
- Use Primitive Alpha-numeric leading to simplified array population with {}
- Ranges (max - min)
- Central Tendency: mean, median, mode

Start and stop counting (boundaries of variables): counting out money or "change"
- Evaluating with simple IF
- Evaluating type of number with modulus (even vs. odd)
- Console output to whether code makes it into IF

Separating the GUI Space intentionally for feedback
- Nested counting (nested FOR Loops)
- "Chess Board" or "Table for Tiles on a Tablet Screen"

Changing Visual Data based on calculations
- Hello World Type Programs for developing touch screens
- Clicking Game with timer, taking best times and giving feedback on times that seem in error

Ratios of Width and Height using Variables: how to write a program's GUI to any monitor
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): communication with device before program executes
- Delivering geometry to variables
- Screensize checker based on fullScreen key variables
- Use exit(), demonstrate Processing.org reference page
- Transition to Happy Measles by drawing 2D Shapes to middle of canvas

# Intermediate Algorithms

General ideas
- Transfer data between 2 variables (making memories)
- Using arrays (traverse, search, use values, replace, length, index, )

### JavaScript

### Computer App

# Advanced Algorithms

Use Processing.org driver with Pure Java Classes, outputted to console with no Canvas

- Jump Search
- Exponential Search

Additional Sorts to Explore
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Partitioning Sort
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort

Ideas to Include for Searching and Sorting (Using Playing Cards)
- Counting times to touch cards (data set), introduction to Big O

## Student Intro Searching and Sorting Assignments

**Begin with Flat Programs to test structured programming execution, then move to *Objects***.
- Note: all object programs must be written with Processing-JAVA Drivers and Pure Java Classes

### Assignment List and Details

Linear Search
1. Flat Numbers Search - Teaching Exemplar
2. Flat Strings-word Search, single word - Teaching Exemplar
3. Flat String- Phrase to Word copy of arrays, then search each word for a target letters
- Note: use Sentence with all letters of alphabet (similar to old Morse Code short sentences)

- Purpose of Linear Search
  - Review `print()`, `println()`, and `character escapes`
  - Review FOR(){} increasing Big-O
  - Review simple array searches
  - Review String Functions in Pure Java

Binary Search
- **CAUTION:** search space must be organized first, according to expectation of binary search code
- For Example:
  - Smallest to Largest
  - Largest to Smallest (Numerical Values)
  - Aphetically (knowing how to get back to original?)
